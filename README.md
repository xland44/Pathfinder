# Pathfinder
Experimenting with pathfinding.\n
This project is my workshop for experimentation and learning pathfinding.
As my endgoal is to assimilate this into my game development, I am using Monogame/XNA.

Additionally, I will probably experiment not just with pathfinding but with additional uses of breadth-search.
